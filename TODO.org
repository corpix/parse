* TODO Return UnexpectedTokenErr intead of UnexpectedEOF in some cases
  If we have some Either(foo, bar, baz) but^
  - nothing matched
  - buffer have some tokens

  Then this is likely an UnexpectedToken error at the position of buffer.
  At this moment we have(from clickhouseql):
  =Unexpected EOF at position '7' while applying '*parse.Terminal(ID: Expression, Value: [69 120 112 114 101 115 115 105 111 110])()'=
* TODO Iterative Parse
  Recursion was a quick choice we should optimize it.
* TODO Fix stringifier bugs
  From test:
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  expected: "*parse.Chain(name: another sample chain)(*parse.testRuleFinite(name: inner1)(), \n*parse.testRuleFinite(name: inner2)(), \n*parse.testRuleFinite(name: inner3)())"
  received: "*parse.Chain(name: another sample chain)(\n  *parse.testRuleFinite(name: inner1)(), \n  *parse.testRuleFinite(name: inner2)(), \n  *parse.testRuleFinite(name: inner3)()\n)"
  #+END_SRC

  All was obtained from the stringifier. The difference in the =\s= count which depends on the length of the line.
  Type name was changed to longer string, this is the case.
